/**
 * @file Firebase Security Rules for LocalDink Firestore.
 *
 * @Core Philosophy:
 * This ruleset enforces a user-ownership model for user profiles and a creator-ownership model for game sessions.
 * Listing of users is disallowed to protect user privacy. Data validation is relaxed to allow for rapid prototyping,
 * focusing on authorization and relational integrity.
 *
 * @Data Structure:
 * - /users/{userId}: Stores user profiles, with access restricted to the owning user.
 * - /gameSessions/{gameSessionId}: Stores game sessions, with access restricted to the organizer.
 * - /courts/{courtId}: Stores court information, publicly readable.
 * - /groups/{groupId}: Stores group information, with access based on group membership.
 *
 * @Key Security Decisions:
 * - User listing is explicitly denied to prevent unauthorized access to user data.
 * - The 'organizerId' field in game sessions is used to enforce creator-based ownership.
 *
 * @Denormalization for Authorization:
 * - GameSession documents denormalize the 'organizerId' to allow for direct authorization checks.
