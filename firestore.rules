/**
 * @fileoverview Firestore Security Rules for the LocalDink application.
 *
 * Core Philosophy:
 * This ruleset enforces a strict user-ownership model for user profiles
 * and a role-based model for game sessions, groups, and courts.
 * Data required for authorization is denormalized onto documents to avoid
 * costly `get()` calls within the rules.
 *
 * Data Structure:
 * - /users/{userId}: User profile data, owned by the user with matching userId.
 * - /gameSessions/{gameSessionId}: Game session data, access controlled by the organizerId field.
 * - /courts/{courtId}: Court data, publicly readable.
 * - /groups/{groupId}: Group data, access controlled by the memberIds field.
 *
 * Key Security Decisions:
 * - Listing of all users is explicitly denied to protect user privacy.
 * - Public read access is granted to the /courts collection to allow easy querying for available courts.
 * - Write access to the /courts collection is restricted.
 * - Ownership checks are performed using the `isOwner()` helper function, which compares the authenticated user's UID to the relevant ID field in the document.
 *
 * Denormalization for Authorization:
 * - GameSession documents include an `organizerId` field, allowing rules to check the organizer without additional reads.
