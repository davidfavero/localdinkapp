/**
 * @fileOverview Firestore Security Rules for LocalDink application.
 *
 * Core Philosophy:
 * This ruleset prioritizes strong authorization based on user identity and role-based access control.
 * It enforces a strict user-ownership model for user profiles and uses denormalized data (e.g., 'playerIds', 'memberIds') to simplify authorization logic and improve performance.
 *
 * Data Structure:
 * - User profiles are stored under `/users/{userId}`.
 * - Game sessions are stored under `/game-sessions/{gameSessionId}`.
 * - Courts are stored under `/courts/{courtId}`.
 * - Groups are stored under `/groups/{groupId}`.
 *
 * Key Security Decisions:
 * - User profiles are private and accessible only to the owning user.
 * - Game sessions can be created by any authenticated user, and access is managed via the `playerIds` array.
 * - Group ownership and membership is managed via the `ownerId` field and `memberIds` array respectively.
 * - Public listing is enabled for courts.
 *
 * Denormalization for Authorization:
 * - GameSession: Contains `playerIds` array for easy membership checks.
 * - Group: Contains `memberIds` array for easy membership checks.
