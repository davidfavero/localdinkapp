/**
 * @file Firestore Security Rules for LocalDink Application
 * @core Philosophy: This ruleset enforces a strict user-ownership model for user profiles and a role-based model for other data entities.  It prioritizes security and data integrity.
 * @data Structure:
 *   - User profiles are stored under `/users/{userId}`, ensuring user-specific data isolation.
 *   - Game sessions, courts, and groups are stored in top-level collections (`/gameSessions`, `/courts`, `/groups`).
 * @key Security Decisions:
 *   - User listing is disabled to prevent unauthorized access to user data.
 *   - Data validation is limited to authorization-critical fields for rapid prototyping.
 * @denormalization for Authorization: The `organizerId` is denormalized within the `gameSessions` collection to avoid costly `get()` calls.
