/**
 * @file Firestore Security Rules for LocalDink
 * @version Prototyping
 *
 * @Core Philosophy: This ruleset enforces a strict user-ownership model for user profiles
 *   and an organizer-based model for game sessions. Public read access is granted to courts and
 *   groups. Data shape validation is relaxed for rapid prototyping.
 *
 * @Data Structure:
 *   - /users/{userId}: User profiles, accessible only by the owning user.
 *   - /gameSessions/{gameSessionId}: Game sessions, writeable only by the organizer.
 *   - /courts/{courtId}: Publicly readable court data.
 *   - /groups/{groupId}: Publicly readable group data.
 *
 * @Key Security Decisions:
 *   - User profiles are strictly owned and accessible only by the authenticated user.
 *   - Game sessions can be modified only by the organizer.
 *   - Courts and groups are publicly readable to allow easy discovery and querying.
 *   - Data validation is minimal to accelerate development, focusing on ownership and
 *     relational integrity.
 *
 * @Denormalization for Authorization: The 'organizerId' field is denormalized in the
 *   'gameSessions' collection to enable authorization without additional reads.
