/**
 * @file Firestore Security Rules for LocalDink
 * @core_philosophy This ruleset enforces a strict user-ownership model for user profiles,
 * while leveraging denormalized data for efficient authorization of game sessions. It allows
 * public read access to courts, with write access restricted. Group access is managed via
 * membership lists.
 * @data_structure
 *   - /users/{userId}: User profiles, owned by the user with matching UID.
 *   - /gameSessions/{gameSessionId}: Game session data, with denormalized organizerId for authorization.
 *   - /courts/{courtId}: Publicly readable court data, write-protected.
 *   - /groups/{groupId}: Group data, with access controlled by a list of memberIds.
 * @key_security_decisions
 *   - User listing is disallowed for privacy.
 *   - Game session writes are restricted to the organizer.
 *   - Courts are publicly readable but not writable by regular users.
 *   - Groups are accessible to members.
 * @denormalization_for_authorization
 *   - GameSession documents include the organizerId field, allowing direct authorization checks
 *     without additional reads.
