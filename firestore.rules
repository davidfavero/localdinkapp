/**
 * @file Firestore Security Rules for LocalDink Prototyping.
 *
 * @Core Philosophy
 * This ruleset prioritizes strong authorization based on user identity and explicit ownership.
 * Data validation is relaxed to facilitate rapid prototyping.
 *
 * @Data Structure
 * - /users/{userId}: Stores individual user profiles; access is strictly owner-only.
 * - /gameSessions/{gameSessionId}: Stores game session data, with 'organizerId' denormalized for authorization.
 * - /courts/{courtId}: Stores court data; read access is public, write access is not defined in the instructions.
 * - /groups/{groupId}: Stores group data; access control based on member list.
 *
 * @Key Security Decisions
 * - User listing is disallowed to protect privacy (except with owner-only queries).
 * - Read-only collections are allowed to be publicly readable.
 * - All write operations require authentication and authorization checks.
 *
 * @Denormalization for Authorization
 * - GameSession documents include 'organizerId' to avoid needing 'get()' calls to verify ownership.
 *
 * @Structural Segregation
 * - User profiles are stored in a private user subcollection to ensure that only the owner can modify their profile.
