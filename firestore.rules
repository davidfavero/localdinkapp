/**
 * @fileOverview Firestore Security Rules for the LocalDink application.
 *
 * Core Philosophy:
 * This ruleset enforces a strict user-ownership model for user profiles,
 * and uses denormalized data on other documents to avoid costly `get()` calls
 * in security rules. Public read access is granted to courts.
 *
 * Data Structure:
 * - /users/{userId}: User profile information, owned by the user with matching UID.
 * - /gameSessions/{gameSessionId}: Game session details, accessible based on organizer.
 * - /courts/{courtId}: Court information, publicly readable.
 * - /groups/{groupId}: Group information, access controlled based on member list.
 *
 * Key Security Decisions:
 * - Users can only read/write their own profile data.
 * - Game sessions are managed by their organizer.
 * - Court data is publicly readable.
 * - Group access is controlled based on the member list.
 *
 * Denormalization for Authorization:
 * - GameSession documents include an `organizerId` field to avoid needing to fetch
 *   the organizer's user profile during authorization checks.
 *
 * Structural Segregation:
 * - Private user data is stored under /users/{userId}, separate from public
 *   court data, ensuring clear access control boundaries.
