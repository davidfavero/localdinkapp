/**
 * @fileOverview Firestore Security Rules for the LocalDink application.
 *
 * Core Philosophy:
 * This ruleset enforces a strict user-ownership model for user profiles,
 * and uses denormalized data on other documents to simplify and secure access control.
 * Authorization decisions are based on the authenticated user's ID (`request.auth.uid`) and
 * denormalized fields within the documents themselves to avoid costly `get()` calls.
 *
 * Data Structure:
 * - /users/{userId}: Stores user profile data.  The `userId` in the path MUST match the `id` field in the document.
 * - /gameSessions/{gameSessionId}: Stores game session data. Access is controlled by the `organizerId` field within the document.
 * - /courts/{courtId}: Stores court data.
 * - /groups/{groupId}: Stores group data. Access is controlled by the `memberIds` field within the document.
 *
 * Key Security Decisions:
 * - User listing is disabled for the `/users` collection.  Access to user profiles is only allowed via direct `get` by the user themselves or via filtered queries.
 * - Game sessions are secured based on the `organizerId` field, ensuring only the organizer can modify them.
 * - The rules do NOT validate the data types of most fields, allowing for flexible schema changes during prototyping. Validation is limited to fields essential for authorization and relational integrity.
 *
 * Denormalization for Authorization:
 * - GameSession documents contain an `organizerId` field to enable authorization without requiring a `get()` call to the user's document.
 * - Group documents contain a `memberIds` array to enable authorization without requiring a `get()` call to a separate memberships collection.
 *
 * Structural Segregation:
 * - Public data (if any) is stored in top-level collections, while private user data is stored under the `/users/{userId}` path.
