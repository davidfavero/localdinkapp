/**
 * @fileOverview Firestore Security Rules for the LocalDink application.
 *
 * Core Philosophy:
 * This ruleset enforces a strict user-ownership model for user profiles,
 * and uses denormalized data (organizerId) to control access to game sessions.
 * All write operations are secured with identity checks. List operations are restricted to queries with filters that scope the results to the caller.
 *
 * Data Structure:
 * - /users/{userId}: Stores user profile information. Access is restricted to the owner.
 * - /gameSessions/{gameSessionId}: Stores game session data. Access is controlled by the organizer.
 * - /courts/{courtId}: Stores court data. Publicly readable, but write access is not defined.
 * - /groups/{groupId}: Stores group data. Access is based on group membership.
 *
 * Key Security Decisions:
 * - User listing is disallowed to prevent information disclosure.
 * - The `organizerId` field in `gameSessions` is denormalized to avoid `get()` calls in rules.
 * - All write operations require a valid, authenticated user.
